🚀 Power BI Project | Shopify Sales & Customer Funnel Dashboard 📊
I’m excited to share a dynamic Sales & Customer Funnel Report dashboard that I built using Power BI while following a YouTube tutorial. This project was part of my learning journey, and it helped me understand key Power BI concepts by working on a fictional Shopify store dataset.

🔍 Key Insights Visualized:

Net Sales, Total Orders, and Average Order Value

Customer Purchase Behavior (New vs. Repeat)

Retention & Lifetime Value KPIs

Sales Trends Over Time (by Day & Hour)

Geographic Sales Breakdown (Province & City)

Payment Gateway Performance

Product-wise Net Sales Distribution


📍 It also includes a detailed data view for granular analysis by city, product type, and payment gateway filters.

✅ This hands-on learning experience was incredibly valuable for building a strong foundation in data-driven storytelling and eCommerce analytics.
